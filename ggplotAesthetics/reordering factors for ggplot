# reordering factors for ggplot

# can do this using setFactorOrder function (also in this folder)
# but sometimes if you have tons of factors and dont want to write them 
# out one  by one as require in setFactorOrder, then use factor:

# Here i hava a df and one of the columns (OTU) contains data (a factor)
# which i want to plot my data according to its order in the original file
# So, after reading in the file, do this:

df$OTU <- factor(df$OTU, levels = df$OTU)

# or if you want them to be inthe same order but reversed then include rev()
# arguement: 
LF$OTU <- factor(LF$OTU, levels = rev(LF$OTU))

# continue with plotting.
