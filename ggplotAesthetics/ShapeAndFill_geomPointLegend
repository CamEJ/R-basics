# when mapping shape and fill to two different variables when using
# geom_point (with fillables shapes 21 - 25) the legend of the fill variable comes up black 
# which makes sense, as ggplot doesnt know which of the shapes you've chosen should be the one
# used to visualise fill colours

# issue is described here: https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/issues/2322

# where solution is: using guides() manually tell ggplot2 which shape to use for legend
# for fill variable (here will choose shape 21 as it's a nice circle. 

plot +  guides(fill = guide_legend(override.aes=list(shape=c(21))))

# ie full plotting:

ggplot(data, aes(x= a, y= b, fill=treatment, shape=time))+
  geom_point(size=3, stroke =0.5)  + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("goldenrod" ,"black","chocolate4", "slateblue","olivedrab")) +# size and line thickness of plotted points
  scale_shape_manual(values = c(21,22))
  guides(fill = guide_legend(override.aes=list(shape=c(21))))
