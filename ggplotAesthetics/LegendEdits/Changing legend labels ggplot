## Often legend labels are ugly as 
## you need to enter them into R with no spaces etc.

## to change them, make plot with ggplot, here plot is assigned name "PP"
## changing info in c() as appropriate and in the order you want it to appear

pp <- plot + scale_fill_discrete(labels = c("Unknown", "Cytoplasm", "Membrane")

## to see a working eg , see 'bar plots MPA data.R'
## or lime study rel abund plots


# if you used the colour, linetype and shape but not fill, 
# during aes part of plotting, you have to integrate the new labeles with the 
# scale_xxx_manual() - ie scale_colour_manual()

# here's an eg for a line plot, with 6 lines
# first i choose what colours I want my 6 lines to be and make an object with this info:

lineCol = c("red", "orange1", "blue4", "lightslateblue", "darkgreen", "seagreen1")

plot + scale_colour_manual(values = lineCol, labels = c("DNA 1", "DNA 2", "DNA 3", "cDNA 1", "cDNA 2", "cDNA 3"))

# where you change the labels to what you want in labels = c()
