## sometimes when arranging multiple plots on grid, you need to get legend out only

# use cowplot package. 

# and command get_legend
myLegend <- cowplot::get_legend(myPlot)

grid.newpage()
grid.draw(myPlot)

# or then use it in plot_grid, eg 

plot_grid(myLegend,plot1, plot2, plot3, nrow = 4, rel_heights = c(0.5,2,2,2))
# here i changed rel-heights so the top panel, ie my legend will be 1/4 as small as its just the legend.
