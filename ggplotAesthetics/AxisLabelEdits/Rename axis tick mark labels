## changing axis text - ie tick mark labels - manually
## in ggplot2

## Here I have a plot of OTUs which are currently plotted as 
## OTU2, OTU6 etc and I want to put tax info instead.
# dont feel like going back and messing with any of the files so 
# will add labels by hand as follows

# first make a vector containing labels, IN SAME ORDER as the ones you 
# want them to replace. (you can use concatenate in excel to add "", to 
# you list of names a little faster. 

myLabs <- c("Myxococcales", "Rhizobiales","Spartobacteria unclass","Spartobacteria unclass",
"Caulobacterales","Caulobacterales","Sphingobacteriales","Bacteria unclass",
"Acidobacteria Gp4 unclass","Sphingobacteriales","Verrucomicrobia unclass",
"Acidobacteria Gp3  unclass","Pseudomonadales","Bacteria unclass",
"Myxococcales","Flavobacteriales","Myxococcales","Acidobacteria Gp3  unclass",
"Verrucomicrobiales","Myxococcales","Pseudomonadales","Myxococcales",
"Myxococcales","Myxococcales","Bacteroidetes unclass","Bacteroidetes unclass",
"Bacteroidetes unclass","Flavobacteriales","Myxococcales","Myxococcales")

# then add to plot 

PTL <- pt + scale_x_discrete(labels= myLabs)
