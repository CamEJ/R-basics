# Flipping axes ie 'reversing' the order they appear. 

# if the axis you want to change is a numeric variable then this:
plot + scale_y_reverse() # y axis reversed
plot + scale_x_reverse()  # x axis reversed

# if the axis you want to reverse is a factor then you need to do this

plot + scale_x_discrete(limits = rev(levels(df$xvariable)))
# where df is the name of the dataframe you are plotting from
# and xvariable is the name of the x axis factor variable you are plotting

# if it's a y acis change to scale_y_discrete
