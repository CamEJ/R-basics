# how to re order a categorical variable plot order based on the values of the numeric variable
# for example maybe want to display from largest to smallest eg in Cleveland plots, like here

#basic idea is to add reorder() to x var
# eg here i found the max value of my variable and called it maxxy
aes(x = reorder(CatVar, maxxy)
# or if want it in reverse;
aes(x = reorder(CatVar, desc(maxxy))


# an example

df %>% 
  group_by(CatVar1, CatVar2) %>%
  summarise(MEAN = mean(value),
            maxxy = max(MEAN)) %>% # here i find out what my max value actually is
ggplot(aes(x = reorder(CatVar1, maxxy),y= MEAN,fill=CatVar2)) + # then I use maxxy to re-order my CatVar1
  geom_point(shape=21, colour="black", size =4) + # add fillable point
  coord_flip() + # flip axes so easier to view
  theme_bw()
