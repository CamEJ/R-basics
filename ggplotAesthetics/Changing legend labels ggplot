## Often legend labels are ugly as 
## you need to enter them into R with no spaces etc.

## to change them, make plot with ggplot, here plot is assigned name "PP"
## changing info in c() as appropriate and in the order you want it to appear

pp <- plot + scale_fill_discrete(labels = c("Unknown", "Cytoplasm", "Membrane")

## to see a working eg , see 'bar plots MPA data.R'
## or lime study rel abund plots
