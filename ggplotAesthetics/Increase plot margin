# increase plot margin
# increase white area around the plot
# using theme(plot.margin)

plot + theme(
        plot.margin = unit(c(0.5,1.5,0.5,0.5), "cm"))

# where the order of those four co-ordinates is top, right, bottom, left.
# so in this eg I want my right margin to be 1.5 cm and the rest smaller at 0.5cm
