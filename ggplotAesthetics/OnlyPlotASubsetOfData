## how to plot only a subset of your data

# so instead of doing grep() and making a new df with certain rows out of a dataframe in it,
# you can use subset() to choose them and feed output directly to ggplot

# for example, here i only want to plot Day1's data from the dataset 'data'
 library(ggplot2)

plot = ggplot(subset(data,Day=='1')) +
  aes(Time, Rainfall, colour=Tmt)+
  geom_point(shape=16, size = 4)
 



 # or if you have more than one condition you want to subset by
 
ggplot(subset(data,Day %in% c("1" , "3"))) + 
         geom_line(aes(Time, Rainfall, group=Tmt, colour=Tmt))
