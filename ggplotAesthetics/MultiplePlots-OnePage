# plotting multiple plots on one

install.packages("ggpubr")
library("ggpubr")

# create plots as normal in ggplot. 
# name them when you plot.
# eg Here i have 4 plots called plot1 - 4


ggarrange(plot1, plot2, plot3, plot4,
          labels = c("A", "B", "C" , "D"), # can add labels. Sometimes these get in the way of the plots a bit if you have too many.
          ncol = 2, nrow=2, # choose how many rows and or columns you want it plotted in. Can leave this out and let ggpubr decide. 
          common.legend = TRUE, # if all plots share the same legend. default is F
          align="hv" # to choose how you wnat them aligned. If its horizontal & vertical then "hv" or appropriate letter alone if not eg "h" 
) # close

# you can leave out or add as many of the arguments above as you want. to start maybe just do
ggarrange(plot1, plot2, plot3, plot4)

# hey presto.
