# with non discrete variables, can set axis limits normal way: eg lims(x=c(0.5,5.5)
# but with discrete vars (eg factors) doesnt always work
# solution is to use expand() within scale-x/y_discrete - instead of where you'd 
# usually use limits()

plot + scale_x_discrete(expand = c(0,0)) # where 0 will give no 'padding' next to plotted factor 
plot + scale_x_discrete(expand = c(0.1,0.1)) # will have a little padding.
