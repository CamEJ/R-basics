## changing size of legend icons when plotting with ggplot2

# usually find one of these two works. 

xx2 <-  plot + guides(fill = guide_legend(override.aes = list(size=14))) 

# or sometime that one seems to just make the line surrounding the icon
# bigger and not the actual icon. 

xx2 <- xx + theme(legend.key.size = unit(2, "cm"))
