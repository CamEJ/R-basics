## converting an already created ggplot plot into an interactive plot using plotly

## you will need to make an account with plotly. From this you will get a username and password which 
## you put in the space below. Follow instructions on link below to 
# set up API credentials: https://plot.ly/r/getting-started

library(plotly)

plotty <- ggplotly(myGgPlot)

# Create a shareable link to your chart

Sys.setenv("plotly_username"="camillathorn85")
Sys.setenv("plotly_api_key"="Yh2kEaXy5gKdmtw0lqVq")


chart_link = api_create(plotty, filename="MyPlot_3Jan2019")
chart_link

## note:there is (currently) a snag where plotly does not work if any of your labels include 'expression_paste'
# when you made your ggplot plot. So make different labels w/o expression paste and it'll work. (April 2019)


## ========== using plotly to put interactive version of a ggplot into R markdown =======

## my ggplot made plot is called plot one. 
# include the plotly=TRUE and remember to load plotly library at beginning of your markdown document. 

```{r plotly=TRUE}
gg = plotly_build(plot1)
gg
```
