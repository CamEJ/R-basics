## Handy data wrangling data bits with dplyr


# choose highest value vars from groups
# 1. from big df, first, group by grouping variable, then 
# 2 within each arrange rows by numeric variable (largest to smallest so desc)
# 3. then use slice to select the first 10 rows of each group
# ie the rows in each group with largest values of numeric var

top10 <- big.df %>% 
  group_by(group) %>% 
  arrange(desc(value), .by_group = TRUE) %>% 
  slice_head(n = 10)
  
  
# similar but choose based on cumulative contribution

#arrange by descending rel abund within group
# then do cumulative sum

df.out <- big.df %>% 
  group_by(group) %>% 
  arrange(desc(value), .by_group = TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(cum.abund=cumsum(value))

# now choose OTUs that make up to 80% of rel abund of each sample
bo.select <- check %>% 
  group_by(group) %>% 
  filter(cum.abund < 80)
