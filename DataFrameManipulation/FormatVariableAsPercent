# after the number. eg i used then when wanted to display percentage change on a plot

# from here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7145826/how-to-format-a-number-as-percentage-in-r/17787615

# run function to label as percent 
percent <- function(x, digits = 1, format = "f", ...) {
  paste0(formatC(100 * x, format = format, digits = digits, ...), "%")
}
# in above, change 'digits = 1' to the number of decimal points you would like. 

# then you can use it reformat your variable. Here i want to make a variable called 'change' into 'percent.change'
myDF$percent.change = percent(myDF$change)

# voila.
