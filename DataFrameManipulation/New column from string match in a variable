# I have a dataframe with my sample names under the column 'variable' and then various observations
# its a melted df so too complicated to add metadata information as usual using
df$time = metadata$time

# so as my sample names include information on treatment, I can
# add new column with treatment variable based on string match with sampleID
library(stringr)
mf$tmt = str_extract(mf$variable, "Tmt1|Tmt2|Tmt3|Tmt4")

# so I will have a new col called tmt filled with values Tmt1 - 4 according
# to the matches it found in my sample names.
