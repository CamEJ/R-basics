# selecting certain columns that contain a string of characters
# eg I have an OTU table and my sample names correspond to treatment
# and timepoint. I can select all the samples from a certain treatment

require(dplyr)
# eg my samples names from my controls all contain the prefix "Tmt1" eg Tmt1_t0_repA

tmt1 <- select(fullDataSet, starts_with("Tmt1"))

# if I wanted to select based on time (which is in the middle of the string then change for 'contains'

timeZero <- select(fullDataSet, contains("t0"))

# or if i wanted to choose all replicate As from the dataset it would be ends_with()

repAs <- select(fullDataSet, ends_with("repA"))
