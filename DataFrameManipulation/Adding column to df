# Add column from one df to another (as long as they are the same lengths)

# eg adding metadata to an already existing dataframe
# So in this eg I add info re treatment (taken from a df called meTa which contains my metadata)
# as an extra colum in data.scores where i give it the name treatment
# ie there was no column already existing in data.scores called treatment -
# it is made as part of the command



data.scores$treatment<- meTa$Treatment

# Did factor() to keep them in order that I input them when plotted
# This will bring up warnings, dont worry about them.


data.scores$treatment <- factor(data.scores$treatment, levels = data.scores$treatment)
