# to change from wide 'excel' type table to R type table

reshape2
melt()
## to keep certain columns and not melt them, include them in id.vars() argument
#eg

m.data = melt(data, id.vars = c("Recipe", "OLR", "HRT", "Temp"))


# and to change back from R type df to excel type aka wide df:

# Cast the library into wide format
all <- dcast(MeltedData, RowVariable~ColVariable)

# where RowVariable is the variable you want along row, ie as column 1

# or like this is other way
reshape(dat1, idvar = "name", timevar = "numbers", direction = "wide")


# this way best though i reckon:

library(data.table)

dcast(dataset, RowVariable ~ ColVariableIDS, value.var = "ColVariableValues")
