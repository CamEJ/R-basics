## adding a new column based on a calculation from an existed variable/column
## using with()

data$colID <- with(data, col2 +1 / col3)
# where:
# data = name of existing df
# colID = name of your new column
# col2 = name of first column you want to base your calc on and col3 the second

# working eg ; using my WP3 carbon and nitrogen data,
# I made a col containing carbon:nitrogen which i got by dividing % carb/ % nitrogn:

CN$ratio <- with(CN, Carbon / Nitrogen) # add new column which is C:N ratio
