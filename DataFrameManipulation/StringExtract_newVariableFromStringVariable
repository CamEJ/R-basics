# I have a dataframe with my sample names under the column 'variable' and then various observations
# its a melted df so too complicated to add metadata information as usual using
df$time = metadata$time

# so as my sample names include information on treatment, I can
# add new column with treatment variable based on string match with sampleID
library(stringr)
mf$tmt = str_extract(mf$variable, "Tmt1|Tmt2|Tmt3|Tmt4")

# so I will have a new col called tmt filled with values Tmt1 - 4 according
# to the matches it found in my sample names. 

## ======== or you can split the string by a certain character ===================
## eg i have a dataset called my data and the first column is called 'id'
# and contains information about a sample treatment eg 1_autoclaved; 2_autoclaved, 3_lyophilised, 4_boiled.

# so to make a new column, called treatment, i would split that 'id'
# column by "_" that character and then say i want the string after the character by putting a 2
# if i wanted the string before the splitting character I would put 1

EG:

mydata$treatment = sapply(str_split(mydata$id, "_"), "[", 2)
 # if there are two words after the split character (each sep by a space) then include n=x argument to include all
 # the words eg in mydata$id i have one row that is 1_autoclaved_30min
 # and I want autoclaved_30min to be in my data$treatment
 # not just autoclaved:

mydata$treatment = sapply(str_split(mydata$id, "_", n=2), "[", 2)


# or to get thing before the characeter we are using to split by
# and putin a column called SampleNumber

mydata$SampleNumber = sapply(str_split(mydata$id, "_"), "[", 1)
