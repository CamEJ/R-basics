## using grep for pattern matching

# eg for pulling certain data out of a dataframe based on pattern matches. 

# eg. I have a df called AllMyData and it looks like this

ID  PeakArea  Treatment Contents
1   923124    100     Standard
2   667567    50      Standard
3   345834    30      Standard
4   122434    ctrl    Sample
5   092543    ctrl    Sample
6   435663    grain   Sample
7   232323    grain   Sample
8   129883    hay     Sample
9   232333    hay     Sample

# I want to take out my standards from here to analyse them
# i will put them in a new df called 'Standards'

Standards = AllMyData[grep("Stnd", AllMyData$Contents),]

# now, if i wanted to analyse the rest of my data and REMOVE the 
# standards from that dataframe, do the same thing but
# but with a minus in front of grep. This means I want everything EXCEPT 
# what matches my string

# in the following eg My new df will be called TrimmedData

TrimmedData = AllMyData[-grep("Stnd", AllMyData$Contents),]

# now say I want to make a new df but just with samples from the hay and grain treatment
# we use the pipe | to separate our strings for grep to match

CowData = AllMyData[grep("grain|hay", AllMyData$Treatment),]
