## Converting some variables to absolute

# ie I have a column with numbers in, some negative some not. 
# certain of these I want to convert to +ve (or absolute no) based on a 
# condition from another column. 

## from: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12007796/how-to-convert-only-some-positive-numbers-to-negative-numbers-conditional-recod

# for example, in the dataframe below, I want to convert negative values
in Temp to positive ONLY if they belong to the treatment 'hot'
    ID  tmt   Temp
1   a1  hot   -20
2   a2  cold  -30
3   a3  hot   32
4   a4  hot   -30
5   a5  cold  12

# make an 'index' of the variable on which you want to base it
index <- data$tmt == "hot" 
# now say you want the absolute number only if that index is satisfied:

data$Temp[index] = abs(data$Temp[index])

# put a - in front of abs if the number is postiive and you want to convert it to negatie


# where i used this: N2CO2 vs H2CO2 fed vials in Specific methanogenic activity batch assays
