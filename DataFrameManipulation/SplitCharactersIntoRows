## split characters with separations such as ; into separate rows

## eg when you have an OTU table and you have columns with counts per sample
# each sample in a separate column, then one column at the end with taxa infomation
# with each taxomonic level separated by a ; 

library(tidyr)
# now use separate to split that the ; separated strings into diff cols
# wehre you put hte IDs of hte new columns you want into the c() brackets

MyPrettyDF = MyDF %>% separate(taxonomyColumn, c("Kingdom", "Phylum", "Class", "Order", "Family", "Genus", "Species"))
