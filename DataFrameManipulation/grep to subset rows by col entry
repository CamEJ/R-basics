# select certain rows based on a string match in a particular column
# eg i want to get all my standards out of a dataframe, so I say that I want to choose all the rows 
# who have the string 'stnd' entered in the column called "Contents"

# eg i want all the rows in the iris data that have the partial string match of 'osa' in the column Species

irisSubset <- iris[grep("osa", iris$Species), ]

# format:

newDF <= FullDF[grep("string", FullDF$ColumnID), ]

# say you then want to make another data frame EXCLUDING the rows who contain the matching string
# then you just use the minus sign in front of grep:

keepThese <= FullDF[-grep("string", FullDF$ColumnID), ]
