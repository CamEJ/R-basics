# select variables by string match in var name

select_data = FULLdata[ , grepl( "Cd|Cr|Cu|Fe|Ni|Pb|Zn" , names( FULLdata ) ) ]


# will pull put vars Cd, Cr, Cu etc from my full dataset



## can also do it to select rows by slightly changing, as appropriate, the location of commas to ID rows and put rownames

phase1 = FULLdata[grepl( "_T0|T1$|T2$" , rownames(FULLdata)), ]
