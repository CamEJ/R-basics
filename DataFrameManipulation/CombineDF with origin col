# how to combine dataframes while adding a column that says which dataframe
# each row of resulting data comes from

# may be other ways, but easiest way I've found is using gdata package
library(gdata)

# if i have three data sets, i just combine them using combine() and names of the
# 3 datasets. It will automatically add a column 'source' where is says which df the data is from

ALLdata = combine(Df1, Df2, Df3)
