# Selecting non consecutive rows

# eg normally when you want to choose some columns from df1 to add to / make a new df2
# you subset using [] and then if you wanted columns 1 to 5 it would be

df2 = df1[,1:5]

# however if cols you want are non-consecutive eg I want cols 1to 5 and 8 and 11. 
# then do this way instead:

df2 = df1[,c(1:5,8,11)]

# simple. but i always forget. so here it is.
