# Removing 'white space' from beginning or end of characters

library(stringr)


df.nsp = df %>% 
  mutate(across(where(is.character), str_trim))
  
  # this will go through and remove any leading or trailing spaces from any character variables in 
  # dataframe called df. it'll put new 'no space' df in new one called df.nsp
  
  # can also choose to only remove leading (left) or trailing (right) spaces
