# Removing 'white space' from beginning or end of characters

#easiest way is if they are in a csv that you're reading in, just add strip.white = TRUE when reading in
# with read.csv()

# of if in a df that you're not reading in then do this way:

library(stringr)


df.nsp = df %>% 
  mutate(across(where(is.character), str_trim))
  
  # this will go through and remove any leading or trailing spaces from any character variables in 
  # dataframe called df. it'll put new 'no space' df in new one called df.nsp
  
  # can also choose to only remove leading (left) or trailing (right) spaces

# or remove a certain number of trailing characters for example below will remove last 4 characters from mdata$var and
# reassign to mdata$var

mdata$var = substr(mdata$var,1,nchar(mdata$var)-4)
