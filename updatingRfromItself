# Run in R Studio

# installing/loading the package:
if(!require(installr)) {
install.packages("installr"); require(installr)} #load / install+load installr
 
# this might bring up a message that your R version is too old, ignore it.

# using the package:
updateR() 
# this will start the updating process of your R installation.  
# It will ask you to chose a Cran Mirror (choose country you are in) & download will begin.
# Done!
