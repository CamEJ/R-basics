## RStudio: installing packages not held in Cran Repository

## find package online -> usually on cran site
## look for Windows binaries, r_devel and download relevant file, usually a .zip file
## find it in downloads, cut and paste in to Working Directory
## send following script to console, changing name of zip file as relevant
## in this example, my WDir was set to Camilla R therefore don't need to put
## whole path to file.

install.packages("~/Camilla R/GUniFrac_1.0.zip", repos = NULL, type = "source")


## if successful should then say:
## package 'BlahBlah' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked

## now load into current work space

library(BlahBlah)
