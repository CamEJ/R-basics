# calculate number of days between two dates

# use R command difftime()

# eg to find num of days between 'date' and 'dayzero' 

difftime(df$Date, df$Dayzero , units = c("days"))

# this will give output as 0 days; 1 days etc. 
# to get just number withouy 'days' after put as.numeric 

as.numeric(difftime(df$Date, df$Dayzero , units = c("days")))

assign to variable in your df
df$DaysPassed = as.numeric(difftime(df$Date, df$Dayzero , units = c("days")))
